  #   RSpec.describe SomeKlass do
  #     use_custom_let(:let_a, :attrs)      # (1)
  #     use_custom_let(:let_p, :params)     # (2)
  #     ...
  #
  # In above examples, (1) provides our suite with:
  #
  #   def self.let_a(let, &block)
  #   def attrs(include: [])
  #
  # , thus this now becomes possible:
  #
  #   describe "attrs" do
  #     let_a(:name) { "Joe" }
  #     let_a(:age) { 25 }
  #     let(:gender) { :male }
  #     it do
  #       expect(name).to eq "Joe"
  #       expect(age).to eq 25
  #       expect(attrs).to eq(name: "Joe", age: 25)
  #       expect(attrs(include: [:gender])).to eq(name: "Joe", age: 25, gender: :male)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # By not providing a block it's possible to <b>declare</b> a custom <tt>let</tt> variable
  # and be able to redefine it later via regular <tt>let</tt>. This will work:
  #
  #   describe "declarative (no block) usage" do
  #     let_a(:name)
  #
  #     subject { attrs }
  #
  #     context "when no other `let` value" do
  #       it { is_expected.to eq({}) }
  #     end
  #
  #     context "when `let`" do
  #       let(:name) { "Joe" }
  #       it { is_expected.to eq(name: "Joe") }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # NOTE: At the moment the feature only works if <tt>use_custom_let</tt> is invoked from a
  # top-level (<tt>RSpec.describe</tt>) context. Correct usage in sub-context is yet not possible.

# Implementation notes:
#
# * There was once an idea to support `use_cl2` in "collection only" mode. Say, `let_a` appends
#   to `attrs`, but doesn't publish a let variable. This change IS COMPLETELY NOT IN LINE with
#   RSpec design. Let variables are methods and the collection is built by probing for those
#   methods. "Collection only" would require a complete redesign. It's easier to implement another
#   helper method for that, or, even better, do it with straight Ruby right in the test where
#   needed. The need for "collection only" mode is incredibly rare, say, specific serializer
#   tests.
